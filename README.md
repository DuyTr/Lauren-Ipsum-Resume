# Laura Ipsum Resume

### Description:
An online Lauren Ipsum Resume: My first Red Academy Project

 
### Stuff used to make this:

 * HTML/CSS
 * Flexbox
 * Responsive web design

##### My thought on the project :+1: :
A very simple project that helps you understand HTML structure and basic CSS styling. It helps me to clearly understand float, which later I replaced and used flexbox. 

There's also a faux parallax effecteffect using fixed background position.
